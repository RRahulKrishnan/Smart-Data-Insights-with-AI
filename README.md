# Smart Data Insights with AI:

Smart Data Insights with AI is a Python-based application built using Streamlit, designed to automate data analysis, transformation, and visualization. It leverages machine learning and AI capabilities through Pandas APIs to provide deep insights from CSV or XLSX datasets. The application aims to simplify complex data tasks and make advanced data tools accessible to users of all technical backgrounds.

## Key Features:

- **Automated Data Analysis:** Perform basic statistical analysis (mean, median, standard deviation) with minimal user input.
  
- **Data Transformation:** Cleanse data by removing null values and duplicates to ensure data accuracy.
  
- **AI-Powered Insights:** Utilize Pandas APIs for advanced data processing and derive meaningful insights and patterns from the dataset.
  
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Generate interactive graphs, charts, and histograms using Matplotlib and Seaborn for intuitive data exploration and presentation.
  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Access the application through Streamlit prompts, designed to be intuitive and accessible for non-technical users.

## Note:

- **Pandas API Token:** An API token will have to be genereated by the user from the Pandabi console do that their services can be accessed.
- **Executing the runnnable file:** python -m streamlit run "filepath/filename"*
